Advanced passkey and passwordless platform with anti-phishing features, offering secure authentication for WordPress and WooCommerce (pro).

== Description ==
ASD Passkey for WordPress, known as JWT EAuth outside the WordPress ecosystem, is a cutting-edge authentication service designed to enhance online security by replacing traditional passwords with advanced methods like biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition) or hardware security keys. As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, password-based systems are more vulnerable to attacks such as phishing, credential stuffing, and data breaches.       

With JWT EAuth, businesses can adopt a modern, secure solution that not only protects data but also improves user experience.

**Key Benefits:**
* Enhanced security with passwordless login.
* Improved user experience with biometric and hardware key support.
* Builds trust through advanced encryption and anti-phishing technology.

**Major features:**
* Seamless integration without additional API settings.
* Standard passkey and asymmetric encryption support.
* Corporate SMTP support for email notifications (pro).
* Customizable email templates (pro).
* Supports login using FedCM (pro).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is a Passkey? =
A Passkey is a modern authentication credential that eliminates the need for passwords. It uses technologies such as biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition) or physical authentication devices to securely verify a user’s identity.

= What is Passwordless Authentication? =
Passwordless Authentication is a method of logging in without using a password. Instead, it relies on alternative methods like:
1. OTP (One-Time Password) via email or SMS.
2. Magic Links (secure links sent to the user’s email).
3. WebAuthn-based Passkeys for biometric authentication.

= Are Passkeys more secure than OTPs? =
Yes, Passkeys are more secure than OTPs. OTPs are often delivered via SMS or email, which are vulnerable to attacks like SIM swapping or phishing. Passkeys use high-level encryption, making them difficult to intercept.

= How do Passkeys work? =
During registration or login, the user’s device generates a key pair:
1. Private Key: Stored securely on the user’s device.
2. Public Key: Stored on the server.

During login, the server sends a challenge to the user’s device. The challenge is signed with the Private Key. If the verification matches, the login succeeds.

= What devices support Passkeys? =
Passkeys are supported on devices compliant with WebAuthn standards, including:
1. Smartphones (iOS, Android).
2. Desktop and laptop computers.
3. Hardware security keys like YubiKey.

= Do Passkeys require an internet connection? =
An internet connection is required for registration or logging into cloud-based services.
For local services that support WebAuthn, Passkeys can work without an internet connection.
